# Surprise-Housing-Case-Study

This repository contains a case study for Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company venturing into the Australian market. The project involves building a regression model with regularization techniques to predict house prices, identify significant variables, and optimize lambda values for ridge and lasso regression. The model assists management in making informed investment decisions and understanding pricing dynamics in a new market.

#### The following procedures were executed to derive the meaningfull patterns and trends in the data and further predict the house pricing based on the potential variables. 

1. Data Reading and Understanding 
2. EDA 
3. Feature Engineering
4. Preprocessing 
5. Model Building - Ridge and Lasso 
6. Model Evaluation - Comparing 2 models

## Key Findings:

##### 1. Property Size Impact: 
An increase of 1 square foot in above-ground living area (GrLivArea) results in a price increase of approximately 1.19 to 1.47 times.

##### 2. Basement Space Matters: 
Each additional square foot of basement area (TotalBsmtSF) contributes to a price increase of about 1.12 to 1.14 times.

##### 3. Quality Matters: 
Houses with an overall material and finish rating of "Very Good" or "Excellent" (OverallQual_9 & OverallQual_8) command prices 1.10 to 1.16 times higher.

##### 4. Garage Capacity: 
A one-unit increase in garage capacity (GarageCars) is associated with a price increase of 1.11 times.

##### 5. Location Influence:
Properties located in the Crawford neighborhood (Neighborhood_Crawfor) experience a price premium of 1.09 times.

##### 6. Functional Homes: 
Homes with typical functionality (Functional_Typ) see price increments ranging from 1.07 to 1.08 times.

##### Brick Face Exterior: 
Houses with Brick Face exteriors (Exterior1st_BrkFace) tend to have prices approximately 1.08 times higher.
