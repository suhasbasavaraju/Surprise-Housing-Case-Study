# Surprise-Housing-Case-Study

This repository contains a case study for Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company venturing into the Australian market. The project involves building a regression model with regularization techniques to predict house prices, identify significant variables, and optimize lambda values for ridge and lasso regression. The model assists management in making informed investment decisions and understanding pricing dynamics in a new market.

### Workflow Highlights

1. Data Exploration and Understanding: Comprehensive examination of the dataset to grasp its intricacies.

2. Data Cleaning: Rigorous data cleansing procedures to ensure data quality and reliability.

3. Feature Engineering: Crafting relevant features to enhance model performance.

4. Data Preparation: Structuring and preprocessing the data for predictive modeling.

5. Model Development and Evaluation: Building predictive models and assessing their effectiveness.

6. Final Model Selection: Determining the most suitable model for churn prediction.

### Key Findings:

##### 1. Property Size Impact: 
An increase of 1 square foot in above-ground living area (GrLivArea) results in a price increase of approximately 1.19 to 1.47 times.

##### 2. Basement Space Matters: 
Each additional square foot of basement area (TotalBsmtSF) contributes to a price increase of about 1.12 to 1.14 times.

##### 3. Quality Matters: 
Houses with an overall material and finish rating of "Very Good" or "Excellent" (OverallQual_9 & OverallQual_8) command prices 1.10 to 1.16 times higher.

##### 4. Garage Capacity: 
A one-unit increase in garage capacity (GarageCars) is associated with a price increase of 1.11 times.

##### 5. Location Influence:
Properties located in the Crawford neighborhood (Neighborhood_Crawfor) experience a price premium of 1.09 times.

##### 6. Functional Homes: 
Homes with typical functionality (Functional_Typ) see price increments ranging from 1.07 to 1.08 times.

##### Brick Face Exterior: 
Houses with Brick Face exteriors (Exterior1st_BrkFace) tend to have prices approximately 1.08 times higher.

##### Please note that detailed insights obtained at each stage of the variable analysis have been thoughtfully documented as comments within the Jupyter Notebook for reference and transparency.
